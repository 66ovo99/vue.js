  <h1>vue.js presentation</h1>

    <p>Vue.js is a framework built with JavaScript, focused on **building user interfaces**. It simplifies complex front-end development tasks like data binding, component-based development, and state management, and provides pre-packaged features and tools. This allows developers to build dynamic, interactive applications more quickly and efficiently without having to write extensive native JavaScript code.</p>

    <img src="pictures/2.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="2">

    <p>Here, we’ve included an agenda to give the audience an overview of th  e presentation flow.</p>

    <img src="pictures/3.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="3">

    <p>Next is the first section: Introduction.</p>

    <img src="pictures/4.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="4">

    <p>Vue.js is actually a progressive JavaScript framework primarily used for building front-end user interfaces.Its features are also quite distinct: simplicity, high efficiency, support for component-based development, two-way data binding, and other integrated functions.</p>

    <img src="pictures/5.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="5">

    <p>Next, we’ll provide a simple demonstration to help unfamiliar viewers understand how to use this framework.</p>

    <p>First, install the Vue CLI. Open the target folder in VS Code, create a new terminal, and enter the following command:</p>
    
    <img src="pictures/6.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="6">

    <p>`npm install -g @vue/cli`</p>

    <p>This will globally install the Vue CLI.</p>

    <img src="pictures/7.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="7">

    <p>Next, use the following command to create your own Vue.js project: `vue create my-vue-app`(replace *`my-vue-app`* with your preferred project name). Then, a prompt will appear, allowing you to choose the version of Vue you need. The latest version is Vue 3. If you’ve used an older version for previous projects and want to continue editing them, make sure to select the corresponding version for download. By default, the latest version is selected. If you’re a professional developer, you can select the last option to customize the version and layout settings.</p>

    <img src="pictures/8.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="8">

    <p>After installation, you’ll see that the system has prompted you on how to run the project.</p>

    <img src="pictures/9.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="9">

    <p>First, enter  `cd my-vue-project` (replace *`my-vue-app`* with the directory of your created project), and then enter npm run serve to officially run the project.</p>

    <p>If you want to use related plugins, you can check and install them on GitHub; however, they’re unnecessary for simple examples.</p>

    <img src="pictures/10.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="10">

    <p>Next is a detailed analysis of each part of the Vue.js framework.</p>
    
    <img src="pictures/11.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="11">

    <p>This section mainly includes configuration files for the project, which beginners do not need to modify at all.</p>

    <img src="pictures/12.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="12">

    <p>The *index.html* page is quite important, as Vue.js renders the entire application at this mounting point, defining the basic structure of the webpage.</p>

    <img src="pictures/13.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="13">

    <p>This concludes the detailed explanation of the Vue.js framework. If you'd like to learn more, you can find additional resources on GitHub.</p>

    <img src="pictures/14.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="14">

    <p>Next, we’ll present a simple example created by our team to demonstrate where each part of the code should be placed within this framework.</p>

    <img src="pictures/15.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="15">

    <p>The basic HTML part can be placed directly in *App.vue*. CSS and JavaScript can either be included within it or stored in separate files.</p>

    <img src="pictures/16.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="16">

    <p>After creating it, don’t forget to go to *main.js* to mount it; otherwise, the system will throw an error and won’t run.</p>

    <img src="pictures/17.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="17">

    <p>Next, we have a small project our team created with Vue.js—a calculator for basic arithmetic operations.</p>

    <img src="pictures/18.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="18">

    <p>I’ve organized the code into categories for easier management.</p>

    <img src="pictures/19.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="19">

    <p>This part is the main section of the JavaScript code.</p>

    <img src="pictures/20.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="20">

    <p>This is the CSS and rendering interface.</p>

    <img src="pictures/21.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="21">

    <p>Finally, the most crucial step is to return to the *main.js* file to mount your project, allowing it to run successfully.</p>

    <img src="pictures/22.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="22">

    <video controls src="pictures/10月20日.mp4" width=1000px height="600px" ></video>

    <img src="pictures/23.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="23">

    <p>Next is an analysis of the user groups and use cases.</p>

    <img src="pictures/24.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="24">

    <p>Firstly, I think Vue.js is very beginner-friendly, with a structure that’s not overly complex, making it easy to get started. As shown in the left image, the usage rate of Vue.js continues to rise.</p>

    <p>It’s also quite convenient for other user groups.</p>

    <img src="pictures/25.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="25">

    <p>In reality, many use cases require extensive structure, real-time data updates, and project integration, which are key reasons why users choose Vue.js.</p>

    <img src="pictures/26.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="26">

    <p>Next, I will present the advantages and disadvantages of Vue.js. Like any technology, it has both strengths and weaknesses.</p>

    <img src="pictures/27.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="27">

    <p>The advantages are evident; however, the corresponding drawbacks are also clear. As the project becomes more complex, the required performance of the device running it increases, and it does not support simultaneous multi-user online editing, which is a significant limitation.</p>

    <img src="pictures/28.png" width=1000px height="600px" alt="28">

    <p>That is the complete presentation.</p>
